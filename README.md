# CloverLeaf_OpenMP45

This is the OpenMP45 (offload) version of CloverLeaf version 1.3. 

## Release Notes

### Version 1.3

CloverLeaf 1.3 contains a number of optimisations over previous releases.
These include a number of loop fusion optimisations and the use of scalar variables over work arrays.
Overall this improves cache efficiency.

This OpenMP45 version is based off of the OpenACC version.

Due to limitations in data movement for Fortran data types, this version does not currently support tiling.


## Note


## Performance

Expected performance is given below.

If you do not see this performance, or you see variability, then is it recommended that you check MPI task placement and OpenMP thread affinities, because it is essential these are pinned and placed optimally to obtain best performance.

Note that performance can depend on compiler (brand and release), memory speed, system settings (e.g. turbo, huge pages), system load etc.
